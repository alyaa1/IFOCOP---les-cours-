      <p>Belligerent and numerous. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way? And I'm his friend Jesus. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

    You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. It doesn't look so shiny to me. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…

    Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now: kill Flexo! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? You don't know how to do any of those.

    It doesn't look so shiny to me. What's with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food. Alright, I'll get you some stupid food. I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.

    You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there! Soon enough. Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?

    Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. Large bet on myself in round one. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression! Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar.

    That's not soon enough! You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.

    Then we'll go with that data file! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Now what? Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer. No, just a regular mistake.

    Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.

    Can I
    use the gun? Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Anyone who laughs is a communist!
