      <a href = "#cible">You seem malnourished</a>. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites? It's a T. It goes "tuh". No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.

Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.

Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Hello Morbo, how's the family? Shut up and take my money! Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! But existing is basically all I do!

I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later. Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.

Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments." Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty?

No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! No! Don't jump! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Say it in Russian!

Kif might! And I'm his friend Jesus. You're going to do his laundry? You mean while I'm sleeping in it? I just told you! You've killed me! It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?

Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Do a flip! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Why did you bring us here? I'm Santa Claus! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once.

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You know, I was God once. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

You lived before you met me?! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Meh. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. When will that be? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? It doesn't look so shiny to me. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I love you, buddy! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. A sexy mistake. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."

Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'!

Do a flip! Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

Why did you bring us here? I'm Santa Claus! You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things. We'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go home. Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. You know, I was God once.

Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence. You know, I was God once. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood!

You lived before you met me?! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Meh. Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh… also, comes with double prize money.

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. When will that be? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly, I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork, every three hours. And those jerks at Social Security stopped sending me checks. Now 'I'' have to pay ''them'! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault!

Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?

Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? It doesn't look so shiny to me. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal!

I love you, buddy! Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. A sexy mistake. Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it. Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."
